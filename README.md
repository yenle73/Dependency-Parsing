# Dependency-Parsing

This repository contains an implementation of dependency parsing, a natural language processing (NLP) technique that analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence by establishing relationships between words. The goal is to provide a clear and concise guide for understanding, using, and contributing to the dependency parsing system.

Before running the code, you need to download the checkpoint file and place it in the <depparse_model_path> in the model pipeline. Checkpoint can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-26_z87LZvQNNNQXNCBFGnXGx0_ysayZ/view?usp=sharing)
